That is the end of that, I promise myself that I will finish it no matter what, it was funny to study and plan a way to put that in practice, but now I've noticed that the better way to finish that is not the most funny, and the days gone up, and, it don't get me excited anymore, so, I will finish this "project" and comeback to study things that make me feels excited.

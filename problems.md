The first "problem" that I got this time was when I tried to find a way to omit the "grade" JSON's field. But, all solution that I get was very complex. It was because the type of JSON that I am using now is volatile, so, I don't know the exact path that the "grade" field will be. I decided that the better for this situation(and situation where I need to separate sensitives datas) is to create a new table and link them with the table with normal datas.

Writing it, I had some problems trying to make a "control panel". So, I notice that I'm not able to make it. I decided that I won't try to make a feature of it (I made more 6 commits today, but no one was good). Now it is the time to plan the backend; now things will become interesting!

I have other problem now, when i was deciding the DB that i will use, i get this erro: `WARNING: MongoDB 5.0+ requires a CPU with AVX support, and your current system does not appear to have that!`, the reason is that my computer is so old, however, there's nothing that i can do about it. So, i will use postgre instead. I had some problems with its syntax, but now everything is okay and i will be able to start the backend process tomorrow... Probably
